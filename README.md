## About me
Hello all ðŸ‘‹, my name is Joshua Urbank I am a developer based out of Austin,
Texas. I am a big fan of embedded development specifically using languages like
C/C++ and tools like Make, CMake, GDB, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on moving to an open-source centric computing
experience using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and de-clouding my life
with tools like [keepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/),
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and
[rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all things embedded, Linux, or privacy related
