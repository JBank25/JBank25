## About me
Hello all 👋, my name is Joshua Urbank I am a developer based out of Austin,
Texas. I am a big fan of embedded development specifically using languages like
C/C++ and tools like Make, CMake, GDB, etc.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my dev setup using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  as my primary editor. Understanding, installing, and configuring the
appropriate [LSP's](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) in particular is what
I am working on within my neovim configuration. I have also begin early work on
a productivity TUI application. The bare bones of the repo can be seen
[here](https://github.com/JBank25/TrackerTui). This project is still in very
early days and ramping on the [FTXUI
library](https://arthursonzogni.github.io/FTXUI/) is my main focus after my
initial project structure is in place.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all things embedded, Linux, or privacy related
